p////////Tesla’s Semi is off to a promising start, despite there being no official pricing information available yet


text///////// 

Tesla has said that its
 cost of operation for the Semi 
will help shippers save money on a per
 mile basis right away, and that’s likely
 meant to help lessen the impact of sticker 
shock when it finally does reveal the upfront
 price. But as I mentioned with the Walmart pilot,
 which will involve a trial of 15 Semi trucks across
 the U.S. and Canada, there’s additional
 value in helping these major shippers meet their green targets.
